# Discord Learning Bot (v14)

This is a discord learning bot made with [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org) (v14).

At this current moment in time, the bot isn't made to be easy to use or practical. The main purpose is to follow through all the tutorials and online content I could find, not matter how good or bad it is (in a practical perspective).

- Example: at this current moment in time, only the "order" command is ""working"".
